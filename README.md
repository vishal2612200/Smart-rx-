# Smart-rx

## Approach

Tried to give an example of both approach static as well as dynamic loading of page structure.

## Json File

"test.json" contain basic structure of json data.

Note: test.json have not been load due to cors-policy of browser, so json is initialized as json data variable inside the "js/index.js"

## Nomenculture

Name have been assigned similar to page structure, that can be later on replaced with some medical field names.

## Output
